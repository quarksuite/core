* v0.1.0 - 2021-04-13

The initial release of Quarks System Core adds several improvements over QuarkSuite 1. For a full
overview of what's different from legacy, consult the [[https://github.com/quarksuite/legacy/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#v500---2020-12-05][Changelog of QuarkSuite 1]].

This project no longer relies on Node or NPM and is instead served directly from the Arweave
permaweb via [[https://nest.land][nest.land]]. Use =https://x.nest.land/quarksuite:core/mod.js= in a browser console or in
your scripts to get started.

TypeScript is also gone to remove the compile step that would conflict with using the library in its
target environments. Basic type information is provided for development via TSDoc comments.

Top level source files are now modules by default, and the below modules should be preferred for importing:

+ =mod.js=: the entry point for the entire public API (aggregates the following)
  - =color.js=: contains all color functions
  - =typography.js=: contains all typography functions
  - =modular_scale.js=: contains all functions for using modular scales
  - =design_tokens.js=: contains all build functions

Lastly, I've used literate programming through the development of Quarks System Core to clarify the
implementation details, so you'll find [[https://github.com/quarksuite/core/blob/main/README.org#source-code][the documentation is also the source]].
